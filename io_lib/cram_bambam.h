/*
 * This code contains an interface for Biobambam and Libmaus to use
 * when encoding CRAM files.
 *
 * Libmaus has its own thread-pool system.  We construct work packages
 * to be dispatched to libmaus.
 *
 * The basic model is that we have a single encoder context, created /
 * destroyed by cram_allocate_encoder() and cram_deallocate_encoder().
 * The context can just be a cram_fd pointer.
 *
 * This context is then passed along with a block of uncompressed BAM
 * records to cram_enque_compression_block(), running in the top thread.
 * This procedure creates a work package and puts it on the work queue
 * passed in. 
 *
 * The cram_process_work_package() function is then called per work
 * package, within 1 or more threads.  Within this function it will
 * call the libmaus supplied write function and when finished will
 * call the libmaus supplied work-finished function.  The write
 * function takes the place of the CRAM_IO_PUTC and CRAM_IO_WRITE
 * functions already defined in cram_io.c.
